C---Notes-by-Chapter
====================
The first repetition structure is the while loop, remember that repetition enables you to perform a task multiple times
without having to declare variables for each turn.

while(expression)     
  statement(s)
//only executes statement(s) if the loop control variable in the expression evaluates TRUE

We must first initialize the loop control variable:
int i=0;

Then we test the LCV using an expression (expression=decision maker):
switch(i<=20)

If LCV evaluates TRUE, the statement(s) execute:
{
cout<<i<<" "
i=i+5
}
//this is where we often update the LCV
